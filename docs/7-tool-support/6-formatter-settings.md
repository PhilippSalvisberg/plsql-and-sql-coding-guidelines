# PL/SQL & SQL Formatter Settings

## Introduction
[This GitHub repository](https://github.com/Trivadis/plsql-formatter-settings) provides formatter settings that follow the [Coding Style](../3-coding-style/coding-style.md) of these guidelines.

Extensive settings using Arbori are provided for

- Oracle SQLcl
- Oracle SQL Developer

Simple configuration files are also available for

- Allround Automations PL/SQL Developer
- JetBrains DataGrip
- Quest Toad for Oracle

There is also a [standalone formatter](https://github.com/Trivadis/plsql-formatter-settings/tree/main/standalone) that can be used in a [Git pre-commit Hook](https://github.com/Trivadis/plsql-formatter-settings/tree/main/hook) to automate the formatting process. By the way, the code blocks in these guidelines were formatted using this standalone formatter.
