# G-1050: Avoid using literals in your code.

!!! tip "Minor"
    Changeability

## Reason

Literals are often used more than once in your code. Having them defined as a constant reduces typos in your code and improves the maintainability.

All constants should be collated in just one package used as a library. If these constants should be used in SQL too it is good practice to write a deterministic package function for every constant.

To avoid an extreme plethora of constants or false positives, a literal should not occur more than once within a file.

## Example (bad)

``` sql hl_lines="2-4"
begin
   some_api.setup(in_department_id => 10);
   some_api.process(in_department_id => 10);
   some_api.teardown(in_department_id => 10);
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql hl_lines="7-9"
create or replace package constants_up is
   co_dept_admin constant departments.department_id%type := 10;
end constants_up;
/

begin
   some_api.setup(in_department_id => constants_up.co_dept_admin);
   some_api.process(in_department_id => constants_up.co_dept_admin);
   some_api.teardown(in_department_id => constants_up.co_dept_admin);
end;
/
```
