# G-1080: Avoid using the same expression on both sides of a relational comparison operator or a logical operator.

!!! bug "Blocker"
    Maintainability, Efficiency, Testability

## Reason

Using the same value on either side of a binary operator is almost always a mistake. In the case of logical operators, it is either a copy/paste error and therefore a bug, or it is simply wasted code and should be simplified.

This rule ignores operators `+`, `*` and `||`, and expressions: `1=1`, `1<>1`, `1!=1`, `1~=1` and `1^=1`.

## Example (bad)

``` sql hl_lines="9 10"
declare
   co_max_salary constant emp.salary%type := 3000;
begin
   select emp.first_name
         ,emp.last_name
         ,emp.salary
         ,emp.hire_date
     from employees emp
    where emp.salary > co_max_salary
       or emp.salary > co_max_salary
    order by emp.last_name,emp.first_name;
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql  hl_lines="9"
declare
   co_max_salary constant emp.salary%type := 3000;
begin
   select emp.first_name
         ,emp.last_name
         ,emp.salary
         ,emp.hire_date
     from employees emp
    where emp.salary > co_max_salary
    order by emp.last_name,emp.first_name;
end;
/
```
