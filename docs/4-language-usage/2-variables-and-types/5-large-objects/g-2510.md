# G-2510: Avoid using the LONG and LONG RAW data types.

!!! warning "Major"
    Portability

## Reason

`long` and `long raw` data types have been deprecated by the Oracle Database since version 8i - support might be discontinued in future Oracle Database releases.

There are many constraints to `long` datatypes in comparison to the `lob` types.

## Example (bad)

``` sql hl_lines="2 3"
declare
   l_long long;     -- violates also G-2130
   l_raw  long raw; -- violates also G-2130
begin
   do_something(l_long);
   do_something(l_raw);
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql hl_lines="2 3"
declare
   l_long clob;
   l_raw  blob;
begin
   do_something(l_long);
   do_something(l_raw);
end;
/
```
