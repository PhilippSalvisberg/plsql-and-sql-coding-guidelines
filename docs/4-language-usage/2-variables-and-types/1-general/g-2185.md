# G-2185: Avoid using overly short names for explicitly or implicitly declared identifiers. 

!!! tip "Minor"
    Maintainability

## Reason

You should ensure that the name you have chosen well defines its purpose and usage. While you can save a few keystrokes typing very short names, the resulting code is obscure and hard for anyone besides the author to understand.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
declare
   i integer;
   c constant integer := 1; -- violates also naming conventions (G-9114)
   e exception;             -- violates also naming conventions (G-9113)
begin
   i := c;
   do_something(i);
exception
   when e then
      null;
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
declare
   l_sal_comm     integer;
   co_my_constant constant integer := 1;
   e_my_exception exception;
begin
   l_sal_comm := co_my_constant;
   do_something(l_sal_comm);
exception
   when e_my_exception then
      null;
end;
/
```
