# G-4365: Never use unconditional CONTINUE or EXIT in a loop.

!!! warning "Major"
    Maintainability, Testability

## Reason

An unconditional `continue` is either redundant (a `continue` as the last statement before the end of the loop) or causes dead code. An unconditional `exit` causes no looping and may cause dead code as well. If `continue` or `exit` is needed, it should always have a condition.

## Example (bad)

``` sql hl_lines="6"
begin
   <<process_employees>>
   loop
      my_package.some_processing();

      continue process_employees;

      my_package.some_further_processing(); -- Dead code
   end loop process_employees;
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql hl_lines="8"
declare
   co_first_year constant pls_integer := 1900;
begin
   <<process_employees>>
   loop
      my_package.some_processing();

      continue process_employees when extract(year from sysdate) > co_first_year;

      my_package.some_further_processing();
   end loop process_employees;
end;
/
```
