# G-4110: Always use %NOTFOUND instead of NOT %FOUND to check whether a cursor returned data.

!!! tip "Minor"
    Maintainability

## Reason

The readability of your code will be higher when you avoid negative sentences.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
declare
   cursor c_employees is
      select employee_id
        from employees
       where commission_pct is not null;

   type t_employees_type is table of c_employees%rowtype;
   t_employees    t_employees_type;
   co_fetch_limit constant integer := 10;
begin
   open c_employees;

   <<read_employee_batches>>
   loop
      fetch c_employees bulk collect into t_employees limit co_fetch_limit;

      <<read_employees>>
      for i in 1..t_employees.count
      loop
         my_package.process(t_employees(i).employee_id);
      end loop read_employees;

      exit read_employee_batches when not c_employees%found;
   end loop read_employee_batches;

   close c_employees;
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
declare
   cursor c_employees is
      select employee_id
        from employees
       where commission_pct is not null;

   type t_employees_type is table of c_employees%rowtype;
   t_employees    t_employees_type;
   co_fetch_limit constant integer := 10;
begin
   open c_employees;

   <<read_employee_batches>>
   loop
      fetch c_employees bulk collect into t_employees limit co_fetch_limit;

      <<read_employees>>
      for i in 1..t_employees.count
      loop
         my_package.process(t_employees(i).employee_id);
      end loop read_employees;

      exit read_employee_batches when c_employees%notfound;
   end loop read_employee_batches;

   close c_employees;
end;
