# G-5050: Avoid use of the RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR built-in procedure with a hard-coded  20nnn error number or hard-coded message. 

!!! warning "Major"
    Changeability, Maintainability

## Reason

If you are not very organized in the way you allocate, define and use the error numbers between  20999 and  20000 (those reserved by the Oracle Database for its user community), it is very easy to end up with conflicting usages. You should assign these error numbers to named constants and consolidate all definitions within a single package. When you call `raise_application_error`, you should reference these named elements and error message text stored in a table. Use your own raise procedure in place of explicit calls to `raise_application_error`. If you are raising a "system" exception like `no_data_found`, you must use `raise`. However, when you want to raise an application-specific error, you use `raise_application_error`. If you use the latter, you then have to provide an error number and message. This leads to unnecessary and damaging hard-coded values. A more fail-safe approach is to provide a predefined raise procedure that automatically checks the error number and determines the correct way to raise the error. 

## Example (bad)

``` sql
declare
   co_invalid_emp_text constant types_up.text := 'Invalid employee_id';
begin
   raise_application_error(-20501 /* violates also G-1010 */,co_invalid_emp_text);
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
begin
   err_up.raise(in_error => err.co_invalid_employee_id);
end;
/
```
