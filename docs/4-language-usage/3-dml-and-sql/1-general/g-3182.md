# G-3182: Always specify column names/aliases instead of positional references in GROUP BY clauses.

!!! bug "Blocker"

## Restriction

Oracle Database 23c

## Reason

If you use a numeric literal in the `group by` clause in an Oracle Database prior to version 23c, then this literal is not required. It is simply a constant.

Starting with Oracle Database 23c, it is possible to use a literal in the `group by` clause to refer to a column name or column alias in the `select` list. However, this only works if the `group_by_position_enabled` parameter is set to `true`. In any case, it is not convenient for the readers of the code to have to count the columns in the `select` list to know how the result is grouped.

Since the meaning of a `literal` depends on the configuration and database version, the intention is unclear and might lead to an incorrect result.

## Example (bad)

``` sql hl_lines="4"
select job_id
      ,sum(salary) as sum_salary
  from employees
 group by job_id,2
 order by job_id;
```

## Example (good)

``` sql hl_lines="4"
select job_id
      ,sum(salary) as sum_salary
  from employees
 group by job_id
 order by job_id;
```
