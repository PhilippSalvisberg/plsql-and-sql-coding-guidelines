# G-3185: Never use ROWNUM at the same query level as ORDER BY.

!!! bug "Blocker"
    Reliability, Testability

## Reason

The `rownum` pseudo-column is assigned before the `order by` clause is used, so using `rownum` on the same query level as `order by` will not assign numbers in the desired ordering. Instead you should move the `order by` into an inline view and use `rownum` in the outer query.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
select first_name
      ,last_name
      ,salary
      ,hire_date
      ,rownum as salary_rank
  from employees
 where rownum <= 5 -- violates also G-1050 literal is ok for a standalone query
 order by salary desc;
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
select first_name
      ,last_name
      ,salary
      ,hire_date
      ,rownum as salary_rank
  from (
          select first_name
                ,last_name
                ,salary
                ,hire_date
            from employees
           order by salary desc
       )
 where rownum <= 5; -- NOSONAR: G-1050 literal is ok for a standalone query
```
