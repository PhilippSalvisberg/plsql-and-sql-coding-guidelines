# G-3183: Always specify column aliases instead of expressions in GROUP BY clauses.

!!! tip "Minor"
    Readability, Maintainability

## Restriction

Oracle Database 23c

## Reason

Starting with Oracle Database 23c, it is possible to use a column alias in the `group by` clause instead of repeating the expression used in the `select` list.

Unless you use `rollup`, `cube` or `grouping sets`, it is not necessary to use expressions in the `group by` clause.

## Example (bad)

``` sql
select lower(job_id) as job
      ,sum(salary) as sum_salary
  from employees
 group by lower(job_id)
 order by job;
```

## Example (good)

``` sql
select lower(job_id) as job
      ,sum(salary) as sum_salary
  from employees
 group by job
 order by job;
```
