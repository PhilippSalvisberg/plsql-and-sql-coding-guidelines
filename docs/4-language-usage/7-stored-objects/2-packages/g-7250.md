# G-7250: Never use RETURN in package initialization block.

!!! warning "Major"
    Maintainability

## Reason

The purpose of the initialization block of a package body is to set initial values of the global variables of the package (initialize the package state). Although `return` is syntactically allowed in this block, it makes no sense. If it is the last keyword of the block, it is superfluous. If it is not the last keyword, then all code after the `return` is unreachable and thus dead code.

## Example (bad)

``` sql hl_lines="17-19"
create or replace package body employee_api as
   g_salary_increase types_up.sal_increase_type;

   procedure set_salary_increase(in_increase in types_up.sal_increase_type) is
      co_increase constant types_up.sal_increase_type := in_increase;
   begin
      g_salary_increase := greatest(least(co_increase,constants_up.max_salary_increase())
                                   ,constants_up.min_salary_increase());
   end set_salary_increase;

   function salary_increase return types_up.sal_increase_type is -- NOSONAR: non-deterministic
   begin
      return g_salary_increase;
   end salary_increase;

begin
   g_salary_increase := constants_up.min_salary_increase();

   return; -- violates also G-1040

   set_salary_increase(constants_up.min_salary_increase()); -- dead code
end employee_api;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql hl_lines="17"
create or replace package body employee_api as
   g_salary_increase types_up.sal_increase_type;

   procedure set_salary_increase(in_increase in types_up.sal_increase_type) is
      co_increase constant types_up.sal_increase_type := in_increase;
   begin
      g_salary_increase := greatest(least(co_increase,constants_up.max_salary_increase())
                                   ,constants_up.min_salary_increase());
   end set_salary_increase;

   function salary_increase return types_up.sal_increase_type is -- NOSONAR: non-deterministic
   begin
      return g_salary_increase;
   end salary_increase;

begin
   g_salary_increase := constants_up.min_salary_increase();
end employee_api;
