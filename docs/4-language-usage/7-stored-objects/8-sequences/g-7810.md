# G-7810: Never use SQL inside PL/SQL to read sequence numbers (or SYSDATE).

!!! danger "Critical"
    Efficiency, Maintainability

## Reason

Since Oracle Database 11g it is no longer needed to use a `select` statement to read a sequence (which would imply a context switch).

## Example (bad)

``` sql hl_lines="4"
declare
   l_sequence_number employees.employee_id%type;
begin
   select employees_seq.nextval
     into l_sequence_number
     from dual;
   my_package.do_something(l_sequence_number);
end;
/
```

## Example (good)

``` sql hl_lines="4"
declare
   l_sequence_number employees.employee_id%type;
begin
   l_sequence_number := employees_seq.nextval;
   my_package.do_something(l_sequence_number);
end;
/
```
